      "answer": "npx is a npm package runner (x probably stands for eXecute). One common way to use npx is to download and run a package temporarily or for trials. create-react-app is an npm package that is expected to be run only once in a project's lifecycle. Hence, it is preferred to use npx to install and run it in a single step. As mentioned in the main page https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx, npx can run commands in the PATH or from node_modules/.bin by default.",

      "answer": "As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting with ReactDOM.render(). Another useful feature of ReactDOM is ReactDOM.findDOMNode() which you can use to gain direct access to a DOM element. (Something you should use sparingly in React apps, but it can be necessary.) If your app is 'isomorphic', you would also use ReactDOM.renderToString() in your back-end code.",
